# Conversing bot
 A workaround to insulting my friends directly, I just let the bot do it.
 
Since this project is me messing around with friends, there is bound to be unprofessional language, and I apologize for that. 

this assumes that you have a data.json where all the arrays of insults/compliments and pictures are stored as string arrays

## Features

- **Insult:** insults the person you are mentioning or insults you if you don't provide it with a target
- **Compliment:** compliment a person or compliment you if you don't provide it with a target
- **Add:** Add either a compliment or an insult to the word list that the bot is using.
- **Frog:** With the mention of my friend's beloved cat "Froggert" the bot will send you a random cute photo from the list of cat photos.
